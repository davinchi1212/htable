2. Eqwyn's fight with the witch king
   + this was already my favorite scene in the book
   + I really like Miranda Otto.
3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
   - on DVD only
   He makes a really funny face when it happens.
8. [@8] <favorite scenes 4 to 8 ar skipped for brevity>
But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the fils is as important
Improtant actors in this film are:
- Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo.
- Sean Astin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend. I still remember
  very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in /The Goonies/

presence at point. With a single prefix argument, add an empty
checkbox or remove the current one. With a bouble prefix argument,
set it to '[-]', which is considered to be an intermediate state.

Toggle checkbox status or-with prefix argument-checkbox presence at point.
With double prefix argument, set it to '[-]',
which is considered to be an intermediate state.
1. If there is an active region, toggle the first checkbox in

   as the first. Wtih a prefix argument, add or remove the checkbox
   for all items in the region.
2. If point is in a headline toggle checkboxes in the region between
   this headline and the next-so not the entire subtree
3. If there is no active region, just toggle the checkbox at point.kkkkkk

* Creating Timestamps
** TODO C-c . (org-timestamp)

at an existing timestamp in the buffer, the command is used to modify
this timestamp instead of inserting a new one.
When this command is used t whice in succession, a time range
is inserted.
When called with a prefix argument, use the alternative format which
contains date and time. The default can be rounded to multiples
of 5 minutes. See the option org-timestamp-rounding-minutes.
With two prefix arguments, insert an active timestamp with the current
time without prompting.<2025-07-01 Tue>
